# Hello World!

As of 2017 I'm a PhD student at Johns Hopkins in Biomedical engineering. I work in the computational neuroscience laboratory studying bottom-up effects on visual attention (aka visual salience). I've also done some work developing appropriate statistical models of neural synchrony and associated hypothesis tests.

I have a blog: http://booseblog.blogspot.com

For those that are curious, my online handle comes from my name and a game I played when I was young (and so was the internet). In the game I was "Big Boose" (pronounced like caboose), and so I used it in my aol screenname.
